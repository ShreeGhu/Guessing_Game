# Guessing_Game<br/>
This the guessing game where you be guessing the random number between 1 to 100. 
<br/> Steps that I have followed to write this code:-

-First, we will prompt the message saying "Guess the correct number" to the user.

-Then, we will ask the user to choose the number between 1 to 100. 

-Then, we will simply use if_else statement to find the correct number for the user.
